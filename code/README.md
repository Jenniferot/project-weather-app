# Weather App

This week's project was to build a simple weather web app that shows today's weather and temperature, and a 5-day forecast using a weather API.

## The problem

I started with checking out the API and tried to figure out how it worked and what kind of information I could fetch from it.

I made a few conditionals to change the color of a section depending on the temperature. I did this with classList.toggle.
And another conditionals to change the color of the headline depending on the weather description. I did that by changing style.color in the js-file.

I used forEach to iterate through the forecast API to get the days and temperature for each day.  

If you had more time, I would have done a dropdown menu so I would be able to choose the weather in a few different citys. I would also have done it responsive, as it's made now it works best for the phone.
